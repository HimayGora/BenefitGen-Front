      <p>
        BenefitGen was founded to challenge a celebrated industry myth: that an acqui-hire is a win. We believe it’s often a sign of missed potential — the failure to achieve product-market fit, even with a great idea and a talented team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often, this happens when technical teams and business stakeholders are out of sync. Our mission is to bridge that gap. We arm technical teams with the tools, insights, and framing they need to win stakeholder buy-in, build lasting value from within, and turn great ideas into undeniable business victories.
      </p>
      <p>
        This philosophy powers both our content initiative, <strong>Stack to Stake</strong>, and the <strong>BenefitGen platform</strong> itself — helping transform technical brilliance into business success.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In today’s competitive market, the best tech doesn’t always win — the best-communicated tech does. We make sure your ideas don’t just get built, but also get backed.
